# Comprehensive Power BI Learning Repository:

## Power BI Projects Repository
This repository contains a series of Power BI projects that demonstrate a wide range of data analysis, visualization, and transformation techniques. The assignments within this repository highlight the progression from basic to advanced Power BI skills.


### Assignment-1: Basic Visualizations with Employee_Reimbursment Data
In this assignment, comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques were employed using Power BI to explore a bank dataset. The primary goal was to develop foundational skills in data modeling and create intuitive visualizations to derive insights into the bank's operations.


- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Project Dataset_[Employee_reimbursment_DataSet](https://github.com/MithunDataPro/Power-Bi-Module/blob/main/Employee_reimbursement_dataset.xlsx)_ 

    **2.** Project Task To Be Performed _[Project_Task.pdf](https://github.com/MithunDataPro/Power-Bi-Module/blob/main/Chapter_2_Ex.pdf)_

    **3.** PowerBI Dashboard Visualization For Above Task_[Power_Bi_DashBoard_Employee_Reimbursment_DataSet](https://github.com/MithunDataPro/Power-Bi-Module/blob/main/Solution%20Assignment-1.pbix)_ 

## Tasks and Skills Gained:
- [x] **Data Transformation and Modeling**: Utilized Power Query to clean and transform the bank data, ensuring a robust model for analysis.
- [x] **Visualization Techniques**: Implemented various visualization tools within Power BI, including bar charts, tables, and KPI cards to present the data effectively.
- [x] **Insight Generation**: Through visualizations, I was able to highlight key aspects of the data, helping in quicker decision-making and analysis.
      
## Visualizations Created:
- [x] Bar charts to compare transaction volumes across different periods.
- [x] Tables that detail transactions by customer demographics.
- [x] KPI cards to display critical metrics such as total revenue and average transaction value.
